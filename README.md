This is a repository for a Dominions 5 map I'm working on called Spiral Dominions. It's currently unfinished.

Spiral Dominions!

A map for four players, two land and two underwater.
7 thrones.
For a disciple game, have one player on each team be land and the other underwater.

Description:
Magic is draining from the world! The cold chill of death is ever-present at the center of the spiral, drawing the magic to the center of the world for some nefarious purpose. The edges of the spiral are warmer, both in the forests and the caves. The purple icons are giant cannons that launch armies across the map - I assure you, the physics are quite sound. A neutral temperature scale is fairly valuable here since there are many terrain hazards you'll need to cross, and a chance for travel in three out of 12 of the months in a year is better than being blocked forever. Luckily indy recruits should be able to supplement any shortcomings your armies may have - but beware the vampires in the farms across the river! The perils of the deep sea should not be underestimated, either... Good luck, and may the best Pantokrator win!

The Spiral awaits...
